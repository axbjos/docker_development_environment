# Axnet Docker Basics
### Up and Running with a Docker Container!

Basic container development using Docker on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine

## This Guide's Approach

To learn about Docker this guide takes a different approach from the usual "Step 1: Download Docker Desktop..." method of learning about containers.  

You will not be using Docker Desktop for this guide.  Instead we are going to create a Virtual Machine and install Docker on it.  Then use Visual Studio Code to build a container and run it.

## Things You Will Need

1. A Computer (any OS, any processor archtiecture - this guide works on Apple M1 machines too)
2. A Hypervisor for your computer to run Virtual Machines: VirtualBox, VMware Fusion (mac), VMware Workstion (Windows/Linux) are popular options.  Apple M1 users can pick from the M1 version of Parallels or the currently free (!) version of VM Fusion for Apple M1 - google search for their public beta that went live in Sept '21
